# polar-bear-run
dino run but its a polar bear
I made this in the winter break last year so the winter break between 2019 and 2020
it took me around two weeks
and this was my first project i ever did
i had been learning java for 4 months 
and had started learning python a month earlier
it is pretty evident that i didnt know what i was doing
and still more evident that i took a lot of the complex stuff from other sources
but it worked
